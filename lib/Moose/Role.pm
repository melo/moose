=head1 NAME

Moose::Role - The Moose Role

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Eq;
  use Moose::Role; # automatically turns on strict and warnings

  requires 'equal';

  sub no_equal {
      my ($self, $other) = @_;
      !$self->equal($other);
  }

  # ... then in your classes

  package Currency;
  use Moose; # automatically turns on strict and warnings

  with 'Eq';

  sub equal {
      my ($self, $other) = @_;
      $self->as_float == $other->as_float;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The concept of roles is documented in L<Moose::Manual::Roles>. This document
serves as API documentation.

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

Moose::Role currently supports all of the functions that L<Moose> exports, but
differs slightly in how some items are handled (see L<CAVEATS> below for
details).

Moose::Role also offers two role-specific keyword exports:

=over 4

=item B<requires (@method_names)>

Roles can require that certain methods are implemented by any class which
C<does> the role.

Note that attribute accessors also count as methods for the purposes
of satisfying the requirements of a role. For this to work, the
attribute must be declared before the call to C<with()> (see
L<"CAVEATS"> below for details).

=item B<excludes (@role_names)>

Roles can C<exclude> other roles, in effect saying "I can never be combined
with these C<@role_names>". This is a feature which should not be used
lightly.

=back

=head2 B<unimport>

Moose::Role offers a way to remove the keywords it exports, through the
C<unimport> method. You simply have to say C<no Moose::Role> at the bottom of
your code for this to work.

=head2 B<< Moose::Role->init_meta(for_class => $role, metaclass => $metaclass) >>

The C<init_meta> method sets up the metaclass object for the role
specified by C<for_class>. It also injects a a C<meta> accessor into
the role so you can get at this object.

The default metaclass is L<Moose::Meta::Role>. You can specify an
alternate metaclass with the C<metaclass> parameter.

=head1 METACLASS

When you use Moose::Role, you can specify which metaclass to use:

    use Moose::Role -metaclass => 'My::Meta::Role';

You can also specify traits which will be applied to your role metaclass:

    use Moose::Role -traits => 'My::Trait';

This is very similar to the attribute traits feature. When you do
this, your class's C<meta> object will have the specified traits
applied to it. See L<Moose/Metaclass and Trait Name Resolution> for more
details.

=head1 APPLYING ROLES

In addition to being applied to a class using the 'with' syntax (see
L<Moose::Manual::Roles>) and using the L<Moose::Util> 'apply_all_roles'
method, roles may also be applied to an instance of a class using
L<Moose::Util> 'apply_all_roles' or the role's metaclass:

   MyApp::Test::SomeRole->meta->apply( $instance );

Doing this creates a new, mutable, anonymous subclass, applies the role to that,
and reblesses. In a debugger, for example, you will see class names of the
form C< Class::MOP::Class::__ANON__::SERIAL::6 >, which means that doing a 'ref'
on your instance may not return what you expect. See L<Moose::Object> for 'DOES'.

Additional params may be added to the new instance by providing 'rebless_params'.
See L<Moose::Meta::Role::Application::ToInstance>.

=head1 CAVEATS

Role support has only a few caveats:

=over 4

=item *

Roles cannot use the C<extends> keyword; it will throw an exception for now.
The same is true of the C<augment> and C<inner> keywords (not sure those
really make sense for roles). All other Moose keywords will be I<deferred>
so that they can be applied to the consuming class.

=item *

Role composition does its best to B<not> be order-sensitive when it comes to
conflict resolution and requirements detection. However, it is order-sensitive
when it comes to method modifiers. All before/around/after modifiers are
included whenever a role is composed into a class, and then applied in the order
in which the roles are used. This also means that there is no conflict for
before/around/after modifiers.

In most cases, this will be a non-issue; however, it is something to keep in
mind when using method modifiers in a role. You should never assume any
ordering.

=item *

Attribute accessors count as methods for the purpose of satisfying requires
but the attribute declaration must be done before the call to C<with()>.

For example, given this role:

    package MyRequireRole;
    use Moose::Role;
    
    requires('attr');
    
    1;

This class will fail:

    package MyClassFail;
    use Moose;
    
    with 'MyRequireRole';
    
    has attr => ( isa => 'Str', is => 'ro' );
    
    1;

But this class works:

    package MyClassOk;
    use Moose;
    
    has attr => ( isa => 'Str', is => 'ro' );
    
    with 'MyRequireRole';
    
    1;

If the attribute is declared inside a second role, you must use multiple calls to C<with()>. For example, given this role:

    package MyProvideRole;
    use Moose::Role;
    
    has attr => ( isa => 'Str', is => 'ro' );
    
    1;

This class will fail:

    package MyClassAlsoFail;
    use Moose;
    
    with 'MyProvideRole', 'MyRequireRole';
    
    1;

But this one works:

    package MyClassAlsoOk;
    use Moose;
    
    with 'MyProvideRole';
    with 'MyRequireRole';
    
    1;
